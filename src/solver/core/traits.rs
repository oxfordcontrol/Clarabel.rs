//! Required traits for types providing a Clarabel solver implementation.
//!
//! This module defines the core traits that must be implemented by a collection
//! of mutually associated data types to make a solver for a particular problem
//! format.
//!
//! In nearly all cases there is no need for a user to implement these traits.
//! Instead, users should use the collection of types that are provided
//! in the [Default solver implementation](crate::solver::implementations::default),
//!  which collectively implement support for the problem format described in the top
//! level crate documentation.
